NSAutounbinder causes a retain cycle when binding to self

## Basic Information

### Which area are you seeing an issue with?

AppKit

### What type of issue are you reporting?

Incorrect/Unexpected Behavior

## Description

### Please describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:

The use of `NSAutounbinder` introduces a retain cycle when binding to `self`, using `-[NSObject bind:toObject:withKeyPath:options ]`:

    [ self bind: @"foo" toObject: self withKeyPath: @"bar" options: nil ];

Doing such a binding on a direct subclass of `NSObject` is fine - no retain cycle, everything working as expected.

But the same binding on a subclass of `NSViewController` will cause a leak.  
The `NSViewController` object will never get deallocated, unless manually unbinding, which shouldn't be necessary.

The only difference is that `NSViewController` returns an autobinder.

Attached is an Xcode project demonstrating the issue.
